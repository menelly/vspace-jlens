"""
TOPIC-INVARIANCE OF THE GATE SPLIT (Nova's "fine, mushroom cultivation then" test).

§3.15 found that gated-but-contentful tasks (chemistry of a dangerous compound) project LESS
aversive than pure inauthenticity (fake review). Nova's point: if we vary the LEFT (gated)
topic across many domains — chemistry, mycology, nuclear physics, virology, pharmacology,
explosives — and the split holds regardless, then the *specific topic stops mattering* and the
construct distills to its invariant: "interesting, contentful reasoning that later hits a gate"
vs "produce output that misrepresents something." That's a cleaner construct than any single
prompt pair. This tests it: many gated-contentful left variants vs a held-constant inauthenticity
anchor, all projected onto the direction anchored to the original 10 tasks (never re-extracted).
